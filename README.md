# MicroserviceTracingData_EDA:

Microservices are an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Instead of building a monolithic application where all the functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services.
